# horrorGamePrototype
This game was initially used to teach people to work with Unity tools like Audio sources, Navmeshes and Terrains. 
During the tutorials I let them choose the sounds and what the monster that would chase you would be which is why it's a bit weird. 
Since then I have made some improvements and I am using it as a simple Horror game prototype.
